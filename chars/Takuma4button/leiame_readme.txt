About this MUGEN Takuma's version:
----------------------------------

- Having 6 buttons, Takuma needed some edited moves and some layout changing:
  - Takuma's Medium punches are complete edits - moves that he never had. Close
    medium punch is similar to AOF 2 Ryo's close strong punch
  - His close medium kick is the KOF'98 VS Kyokugen intro's kick, where Takuma kicks
    his own Tengu mask.
  - Far medium kick is Takuma's standard close Hard kick.This will bring back the
    old KOF'95 standards, since it was his far standing kick in that game.
  - Aerial medium kick is Serious Mr. Karate's aerial weak kick.
  - For Takuma's close hard kick, was used Serious Mr. Karate hard kick. Again,
    that will bring back the old KOF'95 standards, since it was his close standing
    kick in that game.
- Takuma uses KOF'95 projectiles' sprites, with trans. Better than those ugly ones
  from KOF'98~2001/SVC. There are some exceptions, tough - like charged/Cho
  Haoh Shikouken.
- For regular Mr Karate intro, Takuma uses KOF'98 old VS Kyokugen intro.
- To reduce overall cheapness, and, in exchange, gain new features, some changes
  were made on Chou Haoh Shikouken:
  - HSDM version lost his invul when launching the 1st~2nd Haoh Shikouken
  - Serious Mr Karate version is now a SDM. No more Shikouken spam, but you can
    make some cool cancels now
  - Now you can fire 3 slow projectiles, using weak+medium punch, or 3 fast ones,
    using any other punch combination. Quite handy for some juggling combos, namely
    Mr Karate's Kyokugen Kohou~Chou Haoh Shikouken Dream Cancel
- To make some Dream Cancels possible, certain changes were made in Takuma's HSDMs
  - Kosatsu Jin becomes a single attack move if you Super/Dream Cancel into it
  - Serious Mr Karate's Chou Ryuko Rambu becomes faster, but guardable iy you Dream
    Cancel into it. The Dream Cancel version can hit juggled opponents, unlike normal
    version. The same applies to Classic Takuma's Shin Ryuko Rambu
- Now Ryuko Rambu can hit juggled foes. It's a shame that KOF hadn't this feature.
  But you STILL can't hit Ryuko Rambu after Hien Shippukyaku.

About Takuma:
-------------

Takuma learned Kyokugen from his father. Upon being named the heir of Kyokugen,
Takuma married an American woman named Ronnet, and they moved to the then-peaceful
Southtown to raise a family. Both Takuma and Ronnet became parents of Ryo and Yuri,
who were born respectively four years apart. Shortly after the birth of Yuri, Ronnet
fell ill and died. This tragedy filled Takuma with grief, but he resolved to make
his children the best fighters in the world.
Takuma trained Ryo exclusively at the beginning, as he felt Yuri was too young and
that Ryo was to be the heir to the title of Kyokugenryu Master. A friend of his,
Alberto Garcia, sent his son Robert to Takuma for training in discipline. Takuma
swore that he would teach Kyokugen not only to his children and Robert, but to as
many as he could - his heavy training programs, however, are so intensive that most
students drop out early on, and even his children and Robert tend to complain.

In the midst of Takuma's aim to spread the Kyokugenryu discipline, crime started
infesting Southtown, and Geese Howard made himself the de facto boss of the city.
Unwilling to live with it, Takuma fought his way through lackeys and stooges and
confronted Geese himself, demanding that he put an end to the tyranny. Geese replied
with threats against Takuma's children, knowing that they meant the world to him.
Now with Takuma dancing at his fingertips, Geese forced him to work for him. In order
to preserve his honor, Takuma donned a tengu mask and formed another persona: "Mr.
Karate."
While Geese was out on business, Mr. Big was in charge. In order to keep Takuma
firmly under his control, Mr. Big had Yuri kidnapped. Unfortunately, that move caused
Ryo and Robert to tear up Southtown in search of her and Takuma. When Robert got to
Mr. Big and defeated him, Big called for Mr. Karate, and he came out to battle Ryo
by Robert's favor because he was already exhausted. Although Ryo won, he threatened
to kill Mr. Karate if he didn't tell him where Takuma and Yuri were. Yuri stopped
Ryo from killing their father, and they had a joyous reunion.

Takuma led Ryo and Robert as a team in the new King of Fighters for two years, until
he retired and brought in Yuri as a replacement. He remained on the sideline until
1999, when he rejoined the team as their fourth man. In 2000, Takuma welcomed King
onto the team, knowing that she and Ryo have a "special something" together.
Unfortunately, King of Fighters 2000 climaxed with the Zero Cannon wiping out most
of Southtown, including the Kyokugenryu dojo. He couldn't use the Garcia fortune to
rebuild with, as a world financial crisis had virtually wiped it out. He entered the
team into the 2001 tournament to win the prize money. At the end of King of Fighters
2003 he is attacked by an unseen assilant. He apparently recognizes him but passes out
before he telling anyone. It is rumored that his assailant may either be Yamazaki or
Eiji Kisaragi, however, according to the official KOF XI story, it is stated that
Takuma was attacked by "thugs". This could imply that it was not a character from
KOF who attacked him, but a random street thug.

-----------------
About Mr. Karate:
-----------------

Takuma ever denied to be Mr.karate obviously something questionable(all know he is),
Ryo Sakazaki currently assumes be Mr.Karate without the power of his father, but very
powerful. Ryo in his Buriki One, Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition and Neo Geo Battle Coliseum
outfit wears a dark gi and is called 2nd Mr. Karate. He is, however, certainly less
playful and preachy than his other form in the game, and it may be worthy of interest
to notice the difference in the mask used in this form and in others in the same game
and KOF where the character is sillier, but the mask is also comparatively underdeveloped.

--------------------------------
About Honki ni Natta Mr. Karate:
--------------------------------

In SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos there is a boss character (selectable by code), Honki
ni Natta Mr. Karate (lit. "now serious Mr. Karate"). He plays similarly to Mr. Karate,
but is faster, more powerful, has a nearly instant and invisible Ko-Ou Ken attack
(a larger version of the one available to Takuma in KoF 2002), has a different stance,
has some abilities and attacks from the original Art of Fighting (and his power charging
ability derived from this can also be used to nullify most projectile attacks before
they reach him), can use the game's regular Mr. Karate's super moves as specials.
In exchange for his Mouko Burai Gan and Shoran Kyaku, he gets to use the Shin Kishin
Geki super from KoF as a special too. As a result, he suffers from SNK Boss Syndrome.
He wears a darker gi, and his tengu mask sports longer hair and nose, complete with
glowing eyes. How Mr. Karate attains this "form" or status is unknown, and it may
not even be canon. It is speculated this may be when he reaches his full potential
or when encountering an outside power (similar to Shin Akuma).
