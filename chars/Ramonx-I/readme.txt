=========================
 RAMON 71113 VERSION 1.0
=========================

DATE: JANUARY 28, 2002

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** CHARACTER ***

 RamonX is taken from the KOF 2000/2001. One of the most unwanted KOF chars ever :P.
 This conversion is mainly based on KOF2000 gameplay, with added KOF2001 moves and a
 few crappy original moves. He also has 3 strikers, using KOF2000 striker system.
 I decided not to implement modes since it just restricts Ramon to his (IMO) crappy
 KOF2000 version. Please take the time to read the accompanying documentation.
 Mugenized by Sander71113 (sander71113@gmail.com).

 *- MODE:
    1. MIX: KOF2000 + KOF2001 + SEMI-ORIGINAL

 *- STRIKERS:
    1. Another Iori
    2. Vanessa
    3. Seth

 *- Artificial Intelligence:
    1. Hard level - ramon.cmd
    2. Medium level - ramediumai.cmd

 *- REQUIREMENTS:
    1. M.U.G.E.N engine - found at http://www.elecbyte.com
    2. Faster than 300 mhz processor.
    3. 64MB or higher RAM.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** M.U.G.E.N. ***

 To use Ramon X, you need the "M.U.G.E.N" engine, version 04.14.2001 or later,
 which can found at http://www.elecbyte.com (if Elecbyte has resurrected itself
 by the time you read this), or can be found via Google or Wikipedia otherwise.

 adding the line "ramonx" to your "select.cfg" under the [Characters] section.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** SPECIAL SYSTEMS ***

   * COUNTER HIT  - Allows for another free hit. This is most obvious when using knockdown
                    attacks. Some moves are not affected by counter hit (ex. Sweep). Use it
                    to your advantage.

   * GUARD CRUSH  - RamonX can be Guard Crushed. So don't block too much :P. My Guard Crush
                    System is not KOF accurate since it is still not built into the M.U.G.E.N
                    engine itself. This is just a "work around". It works much like SFA3.
                    You can see the guard crush points in debug display.

   * DIZZY        - RamonX Can be dizzied. Again this is not KOF accurate. You can also check
                    the dizzy points in Debug Display.

   * THROW CANCEL - Tired of being thrown around? You cancel ramonX's BASIC throws by pressing
                    any punch button during the first few frames of his throw, KOF98 style.

   * WIRE DAMAGE  - Some of ramonX's attacks have wire damage capabilities. This will cause the
                    enemy to bounce off a wall, which allows for further juggling :).
                    -KOF2001 STYLE-

   * TAUNT        - KOF2000 taunt is implemented, it uses 1 power stock while adding 1 striker
                    bomb. You can not cancel out of the taunt so use wisely.


 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** M.U.G.E.N JOYSTICK CONFIGURATION ***

 (Player 1)

 *- DIRECTION KEYS

		     (U)           U = up        DF = downforward

 		 (B)  x  (F)       B = back      DB = downback

  		     (D)           F = Forward   UF = upforward

		                   D = down      UB = upback

 *- BUTTONS

		 (x) (y) (z)       x = light punch    y = hard punch   z = No Use

		 (a) (b) (c)       a = light kick     b = hard kick    c = No Use

		     (s)                              s = start


 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** RAMONX STRIKER SYSTEM ***

 NOTE: RamonX's Striker System works like KOF 2000. You get 3 Striker Bombs for the
       first round, then adds another one for the next rounds. You can call a striker
       Anytime except when being hit or thrown and when doing DM/SDMs (ACTIVE STRIKER SYSTEM).
       You can also add striker bombs by using taunt which costs 1 power stock.

 STRIKER ON/OFF TOGGLE:
 During 1st Round Intro, you can enable/disable use of striker by pressing back or forward
 There is no default striker toggle, It randomly toggles on/off before round 1. So be sure
 to pick your striker preference by not skipping the intro in round 1.
 Forward - Striker: On
 Back    - Striker: Off

 ALTERNATIVE STRIKER:
 RamonX can now choose between 3 strikers (A_iori, Vanessa & Seth). You can change strikers
 by pressing lp+hk.

 (y)+(a) - Striker Summon

 (x)+(b) - Striker Change

 Start - Taunt adds 1 striker bomb and uses 1 power stock

 STRIKER DESCRIPTIONS:

 1. A_iori  : -KOF2000 attack-    Jump in Kick then rainbow attack (OTGs).
 2. Vanessa : -KOF2000 attack-    Dash punch then machine gun puncher.
 3. Seth    : -KOF2000 attack-    Jump in Kick, land and stand, then walk.
                                  Auto attacks when enemy is in range.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *** ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM ***

 RamonX has a 3 level AI. All you have to do is edit ramonx.def using notepad.

 ;cmd   = ramon.cmd        ;Hard AI
 ;cmd   = ramedai.cmd      ;Medium level AI
 cmd    = ranoai.cmd       ;Low level AI

 Just remove the semicolon AT THE START OF THE LINE before the AI level of your choice and make
 sure the unwanted levels have semicolon before them. In the example above, it is setup to use
 low level AI.


 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 *** DM/SDM SHORTCUTS ***

 -* I used the idle buttons (z,c) as DM shortcuts. YOU CAN REMOVE THESE SHORTCUTS!!!
    You'll just have to delete the shortcut cmd portion in the .cmd file you are using.
    You can also set it to "roll" for dodge and "shingo" for striker.
