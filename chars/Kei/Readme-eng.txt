	[NOTES]
	
	-OMG, I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M STILL WORKING ON THIS. Mind you, another update is coming, since
	she's lacking her special intro against a character that is still in the works.
	-About Kei
	Kei was originally intended to play the role of one of the main characters in an RPG of 
	mine,"Rain".At first her appearance was completely different than the one she has (except
	for the short hair),but one day I had some spare time and I decided to do some custom
	palettes for AthenaEX (the one with 99's top,97's bottom and leggings).Then,I don't know
	exactly what happened:I liked one of the palettes and I decided to start over a new
	character.(Don't ask me how - it's still a dark hour of my life -.-)
	Then I started ripping 2k1 Athena's sprites,and here I go!
	-Did you noticed that most of her moves' name are heavy metal/hard rock songs?
    -	"Dream" is from Norther
	"Stained Glass Cross" is by Down
    -	"Angel Claw" is by Arch Enemy
	"1776" and "Burnt Offerings " are by Iced Earth
    -	"Shut Your Mouth!" is by Pain
    -	"Dawn of Victory" is by Rhapsody
	"Goddess of the sadman" is by Amorphis
	"Mind on fire" is by Kreator
	"Scream of anger" is by Europe
	and "Howling Fury"(Furies in the original title) is by Anthrax.
	well,I didn't have time to made some move names on my own.Forgive me -.-
	-A friend of mine told me that she looks like (and shares the same name though) a 
	character of the Gantz manga comic.Well,actually she DOES,but it wasn't my intention. 
	XD
    -Without my expectation,some people made a lot of palettes for Kei,that brings the number
    of avalaible palettes over 12.To enable the other palettes,just replace in Kei's def file
    the name of the .act file you want to change with another one.
  
    



	[CHARACTER'S BACKGROUND INFORMATIONS]
	Birthplace:     Japan
	Birth date:     February 14,19??(17 yrs old)
	Height:         1.71 m
	Weight:         58 kg  
	Blood type:     0
	Hobbies:        Videogames, Shoujo Manga, Anime
	Favourite food: Italian-style Pizza
	Favourite sport: Baseball 
	Most valuable:  her friends,dressing with tight outfits, shopping
	Hates the most: backstabbers, sex-addicts, and flower pollen (due to allergy issues)
	Fighting style: Kung Fu + personal style

	Her story is going to be f*cking retconned. I mean, if you're framed of murder and you managed to
	run away from your own country, why would you come back to it in the first place? If you're trying
	to run, why would you join martial arts tournaments that, even under a false name, would make
	all of the people around you know about your presence? I mean, come on, a japanese with red hair and
	blue eyes is something that is clearly recognizable even by someone who knows nothing about her.
	
	She might be stupid, but no one is that stupid, not even Mika, who (currently) has a low IQ and all.
	No wonder the police managed to find her in the end. Big f*cking no.
	
	And that means her ending is going to be different, much to XCB's happiness.

	Also, FUCK SNKP. I'm going to change the whole setting and putting it in an original setting. No more
	NESTS, Igniz and whatnot.




	One thing is for sure: the fact that she is heavily allergic to pollen will be just to spice things up.
	That means she would kick your ass if you bought her flowers. If she was real, of course.

	Kei,

	under the [Characters] section.Then Run mugen,and have fun ^_^

	[MOVELIST]
	
	Kei uses a KOF-type gameplay,altough she has some FX that noone of the KOF games
	woul allow.
	
	I still have to handle this kind of gameplay perfectly,anyway.-_-
	Suggestions are welcome.

    -USUAL KOF-TYPE GAMEPLAY MOVES-

	-POWER BUILD-
	A+B
	Kei gains power.You can gain up to 3 power stocks with this move.	

    -DODGE-
    A+X or Z
    Kei dodges the opponent's attack.You can cancel a standing block into this if you
    have at least 1000 power.

    -KNOCKDOWN ATTACK-
    B+Y or C
    Kei attempts to knockdown the opponent.You can cancel a standing block into this if you
    have at least 1000 power.

    -THROWS-
    F+Y or B near opponent. Now, each buttoh has a different throw - Y sends the opponent flying forward, while B grabs the 	opponent and throws him on the other side.

    -COMMAND ATTACKS-

    -Dream-
    F+A
    it's just like Athena's F+A attack.I really had few ideas on how to change this. .-.

    -SPECIAL MOVES-
	
	-Angel Claw-
	QCF + X/Y
	Kei uses her lightning power to strike a bolt at short range

	-Wing Fall-
	QCF + A/B
	Kei thrust forwards trying to hit her opponent with a flying kick

    -Stained Glass Cross-
	DP + A/B
	Cannon Spike.And Kei still thinks that she invented this move! -.-
    
    -1776-
    QCB +X/Y
    An electric charged punch.Think of it like a short-range Hishouken.
    X version is quicker to pull off than Y version and can be used in combos,
    while Y version travels forwards and deals more damage.

    -Goddess of the sadman-
    QCB +X/Y in air
    Kei shoots an electricity charged projectile at a 45° degree towards ground.
    The typical air projectile. (ok,i run out of ideas maybe? -_-')
   
     -Mind on fire-
    DP +X/Y 
    A quick combo of 2 punches,the latest one juggles the opponent.
    
    -Scream of anger-
    Charge B,F+A/B
    Another Cammy-ripoff move.Looks like Kei's an huge Cammy fan.
    Weak version deals 2 hits,while strong does 3.
    
	-DESPERATION MOVES- (NEED LV1 POWER)

	-Howling Fury-
	QCB,HCF + X/Y
	A 21 hit combo,being its lasts attacks a very quick series of punches

    -Dawn of victory-
    -QCB,QCB + A/B
    Kei kicks the enemy,executes a Stained glass cross,slams her opponent on the
    ground and proceeds to electrocute him by throwing herself as a lightining
    bolt on her foe.

    -Burnt Offerings-
    -QCB,QCB + X/Y
    A charge-up fireball move.If fully charged,it's  unblockable.
    
	-SUPER DESPERATION MOVES- (NEED LV2 POWER)

	-Howling Fury-
	QCB,HCF + X+Y
	Kei executes her Howling Fury,but after she executes the last blow,she
	jumps forward and strike once more the opponent with a dunking attack

    -HIDDEN SUPER DESPERATION MOVES- (NEED LV2 POWER AND LIFE < 25%) 

	-SHUT YOUR MOUTH!!!-
	B,HCB + A+B
	You have to see it in action to judge it.
	Can be blocked only by standing opponents.Airborne and crouching's guard
	will be crushed,and the move will connect.
	Well,use at you own risk.
