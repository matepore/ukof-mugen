- any other similar gameplay.


Expect:

  redundant ones);

Well... if you disagree with this, I suggest you don't even try to use it. Just
forget this char. ONE game conversion isn't my goal.

Once with this understood, let's procede.

Yashiro is a lonely man who wanders the world playing his guitar. Ever since he
has memory, Yashiro only remembers playing his guitar in local places, and getting
in a brawl once in awhile. Getting tired of his hometown, Yashiro grabs his things
and begins to travel around the globe.
Yashiro then finds two persons who he seems to identify himself with: in France, he
meets Shermie, a beautiful woman who plays the keyboard. Besides noticing something
very familiar in her, Yashiro was very attracted to her. Then, in Sweden, Yashiro
meets a little kid called Chris, who was an antisocial child, but seemed to be very
friendly with Yashiro. He plays the drums, so Yashiro has formed a music band. Soon,
the band begins to play around the world, and thousands of fans claim them. Yashiro
feels alive, and sometimes even feels the souls of the crowd. But Yashiro also feels
a sort of special bond between him and his two partners. Something beyond life and
death...

Yashiro was excited when he was invited to play at a big performance in Japan as the
lead stars. Yashiro rehearsed hard to be as good as ever, and Shermie and Chris were
a bit tired out because of this. The big day arrived, and a roaring crowd arrived at
the scene, a number which Yashiro had never seen. His fingers were trembling with
excitement, but was left out cold when the manager tells them they have to wait their
turn. Yashiro furiously demands an explanation, and the manager tells them a new band
has appeared recently and has gained a large number of fans. Yashiro walks with rage
towards front stage. He then sees a red-haired man at stage, driving the crowd wild.
Yashiro left, anger flowing in his eyes, but he also seemed to feel something in that
man's soul that made him feel so familiar...the same feeling he sensed with Shermie
and Chris as well.
Yashiro passed the last few days training in his fighting style rather than rehearsing,
and get his chance against the red-haired devil. His chance came when the King of
Fighters tournament arrived. Yashiro did not have an invitation, so he recommended
his friends to go get some "free" invitations. When they accomplish their mission,
Yashiro is now ready to kick that man's butt! It seems his name is Iori Yagami, and
Yashiro now marks him as his prey in the tournament. However, not much later, Yashiro
begins to feel how his blood boils, as his Orochi blood begins to awaken. He would
soon arise as one of the four Heavenly Kings of Orochi, and would fight to gather
fighting energy for Orochi! Yashiro becomes the most fearful threat for the fighters,
and when he is finally defeated after many sacrifices, Yashiro tells them that it is
useless now, since Orochi has received enough energy. He and Shermie then kill themselves
to fully awaken the Orochi. It is unknown if Yashiro survived later...

Yashiro is a proud, arrogant man, who thinks that his good looks rival his own skills.
He also always seems to appear that after a fight, he is not tired. He also makes fun
of the opponent's skills, and does not like to be accompanied by weaklings. Yashiro's
passion lies in his music, though, and in his friendship with Chris and Shermie. He
seems to like Shermie as well. However, Yashiro has no other path but to follow his
duty as a Heavenly King of Orochi, and fight to sacrifice his life for the Orochi.
