Megumi is the elder sister of the Shinigami family. She always took care of her brother 
Rikard,who suffered a mysterious heart disease,that didn't allow him to do nothing but staying home 
most of the day. Also,she lost her father in a car accident when she was 8 (and Rikard was 6),
the same accident that put her mother in a deep coma. She woke up 5 years later,during 
which Megumi and Rikard lived with their grampa.

Sadly,she wasn't able to walk anymore,and when Megumi's grandpa died(1999),Megumi was the only
person who was able to guide her family. She,however,didn't have a strong strength of will:she
even considered committing suicide,but that night something happened,that changed her life forever.
Rikard had a faint. The hospital couldn't send any ambulance,so she had to bring Rikard to the
hospital by herself,with her car. Suddendly,it started raining. Megumi,not being so good at driving,
hit a pedestrian,that turned out to be Eiji Shirow. She stopped,begged for pardon,and asked him
if he could drive her car to the hospital,because of her "incredible" driving skills. Eiji was
going to refuse,but when Megumi started crying,he accepted and drove her car to the hospital.
The 2 ended up together,and Eiji even became Rikard's best friend.

One day,Eiji came her home with a huge amount of money,saying he won the lottery and that he
was able to pay both the operations on Rikard and Megumi's mother.Megumi was suspicious,but she
never asked from where that money actually came from...


Rikard recovered quickly from his disease. One day,Megumi and Eiji brought him on a field trip outside the city.
When Rikard was completely out of energy,Eiji decided to stay with him,and Megumi told them that she'll 
be waiting for them at the car. She ran forward,but she found a man with a killer look. The man introduced himself as
Tetsuya Kirazaki,and told to his mate,a young man with blue eyes,to kill her,in order to
lure Eiji Shirow there. Megumi was scared,but managed to avoid the martial arts attacks executed
by the young man. Then she ran out of control,jumped on the man's head,and showed her powers for
the first time,by burning his back with an explosion of blue flames.
He recovered from the hit,grabbed her and ran away from an angered Tetsuya. He later introduced 
himself as Masaki Hikage,and tried to explain to Megumi something about her powers,but some 
soldiers from a mysterious organization showed up,knocked down Masaki and kidnapped Megumi.
She woke up some days later in a tube,submerged by a strange liquid.She was numb,and the only 
thing she was able to see was a reflection of herself - but her eyes weren't blue anymore,but
red as fire.
She then realized that she was under some kind of experiment,and thought she would never see 
again the light of the day.

She was wrong.

1 year later,the laboratory was in an emergency state:one of theirs guinea pigs escaped,and
started blowing away all their instruments. He started breaking most of the tubes,being
one of them, the one where Megumi was held.
She looked at the man,who was still continuing his destruction opera,and recognized him,behind
his silver hair and red eyes:her brother!"He came here to save me",she thought,but she suddendly
realized that one of the blasts was going towards her.She thought she was going to die,but the
blast dissolved right before her.


When she opened her eyes,her brother was gone,and so were almost all the scientists in the lab.
The remaining ones tried to escape,but she killed them without any hesitation.She then realized
what she did,thus becoming very scared of herself.
She then looked herself in a mirror:she didn't look at all like she was before the experiments
started...she was somehow younger,and her eyes had a purple-ish hue.Then she took a look at the
computer monitors,and realized what was going on:their experiments awakened her true self:a powerful
goddess,the one that would take full control of her body every time she felt scared or unsure.
She didn't have any clue on how to stop it,but remembered about Masaki and what he was trying
to say.She then started looking for him,while trying to hide herself from Rikard and Eiji,to 
know what she had to do to seal her true self forever.

Megumi was a very outgoing girl,but when she realized her true self was a mercyless goddess,her
life that always looked so bright turned into dark.She became very silent,sad,
and the only hope she has to save her from herself is Masaki. She's very scared of meeting
Eiji or Rikard,because she feels she is not ready to meet them.
But she still has a question:the scientists' notes were about herself and 3 other goddesses,
that still weren't identified.So,who are the other 3?


Your will is strong to have read all of this. Let's continue.

-Seal Combination-
HCF,a/b

-DESPERATION MOVES-
(need 1000 power/2000 power if canceled from a special)

-Moonlight Obsession-
QCF,HCB,a/b
Megumi shoots a projection of herself towards the opponent. If it misses, she'll be dizzy for a while. If it connects, she'll proceed to grab the opponent, jump on his shoulders, and burn him down with countless fire pillars.

-SUPER DESPERATION MOVES-
(need 2000 power)

-Moonlight Wave-
QCB,HCF,x+y
Like the Moonlight wave.Deals 3 more hits and has invincibility to standing attacks in the
1st part. This one looks like Orochi Nagi, though.

(need 2000 power)

-Glowing sword of the Goddess of Moon-

Differently from other HSDMS, this one can be executed as many times you want as long as you have 2000 power.
However, the damage dealt depends on how much damage you received during the round. Using this attack with less than 10% life will probably kill your opponent in a single shot.





9-[IMPORTANT NOTICE]
In the recent past,some random thief dared to steal codes from my Kei character for his "character".
This reminded me that NO ONE IS AUTHORIZED TO USE MY CODES OR TO HOST *ANY* OF MY CHARACTERS 
WITHOUT MY EXPLICIT AND WRITTEN AUTHORIZATION.
If you really want to take something from my characters,or to host them,you're welcome,as long 
as you ask me before.
If this happens again,I'll put the characters offline(except,maybe,for the ones I did with
Cloud and Speculum),and you'll have to wait for my complete game release to get them again.
whoops,spoiled it :O
