;-----------------------------------------------------------
; How to customize
;-----------------------------------------------------------
; First of all, set filenames under [Files].
; 
; Next, you can customize each component of the fight screen.
; A component can be anything from a piece of the lifebar,
; to the text that signals a K.O.
;
; Each component starts with its name, followed by a period,
; and then the names of its elements. For example, a
; component named "bg" with an element of "anim" looks
; like "bg.anim".
;
; There are several main element types:
;   1. anim (animation)
;   2. spr  (sprite)
;   3. font (text)
;   4. snd  (sound)
; 
; 1. anim
;    Format: anim = actionno
;    actionno is the number of the action to use. You must
;    specify a valid action that is defined within this file.
;    The sprites for the animation come from the file given
;    for the "sff" parameter in the [Files] group below.
;    You can define your animation actions anywhere in this
;    file, as long as it does not come in the middle of a
;    group (an example of a group is the block of text
;    starting with [Files], and ending on the next group
;    [Lifebar]).
;    For example, to use action 5 for the p1.bg0 component:
;      p1.bg0.anim = 5
;
; 2. spr
;    Format: spr = spritegrp, spriteno
;    This is the identifier pair for the sprite you to
;    display.
;    For example, to show sprite 103,0 for a component named
;    p1.throw:
;      p1.throw.spr = 103,0
;
; 3. font
;    Format: font = fontno, fontbank, alignmt
;            text = text
;    This lets you set the font (and optionally the content
;    text). fontno is the number of the font defined under
;    [Files]. For instance, for the line "font2 = font/num1.fnt",
;    the fontno is 2.
;    fontbank is the color bank of the font to use. Refer to
;    the font for what color banks it has.
;    alignmt is a number representing the text alignment.
;    1 is left, 0 means center, and -1 is for right-alignment.
;    The "text" element should accompany the "font" element
;    wherever necessary. The following example will display
;    "FIGHT!" using font 1, bank 1, with center-alignment.
;      fight.font = 1,1, 0
;      fight.text = FIGHT!
;
; 4. snd
;    Format: snd = sndgrp, sndno
;    This is the identifier pair for the sound effect to
;    play. The .snd file that the sound is played from
;    is given in the "snd" parameter in the [Files] group.
;    This plays sound 21,0 for the "level1" component.
;      level1.snd = 21,0
; 
; Take note that the anim, spr and font element types are
; mutually exclusive; you can only use one of them per
; component.
;
; The types of elements supported vary with the component.
; Usually the anim, spr and font elements are interchangeable
; for a component. However, in some cases only one element
; type may be used. An example of this is found under [Combo]:
;   counter.font = 2,4  ;Font for combo counter
; You cannot use an animation or a sprite to represent a
; numeric counter, so it only makes sense to define a font
; for use.
;
; There are other element types that do nothing on their
; own. They can be used with display element types
; (spr, anim and font) to gain more control. These
; have no meaning when used with the snd element.
;   5.  offset
;   6.  displaytime
;   7.  facing
;   8.  vfacing
;   9.  layerno
;   10. scale
;
; 5. offset
;   Format: offset = x, y
;   Displaces the display element horizontally by x pixels,
;   and vertically by y pixels.
;   If this element is omitted, the offset is assumed to
;   be 0,0.
;
; 6. displaytime
;   Format: displaytime = time_in_ticks
;   This element defines the time to display the component.
;   If omitted, the default display time varies with element
;   type. For spr and font elements, the default displaytime
;   is 1. For anim, it is the looptime of the animation.
;   This example displays the text "FIGHT!" for 45 game
;   ticks:
;     fight.font = 1,1, 0
;     fight.text = FIGHT!
;     fight.displaytime = 45
;
; 7. facing
;   Format: facing = dir
;   Sets the horizontal flipping of the display element.
;   1 means no flipping, and -1 means flip horizontally.
;   Does not affect "font" elements. Defaults to 1 if
;   omitted.
;
; 8. vfacing
;   Format: vfacing = dir
;   Sets the vertical flipping of the display element.
;   1 means no flipping, and -1 means flip vertically.
;   Does not affect "font" elements. Defaults to 1 if
;   omitted.
;
; 9. layerno
;   Format: layerno = no
;   This element lets you set the layer to which the
;   display element will be drawn on. 0 is in front of
;   the background, but behind the players. 1 is in
;   front of the players, but behind the foreground.
;   2 is in front of the foreground. The default is 0
;   in most cases.
;   An example of where this might be useful is when
;   you want to have the life or power bars appear
;   on top. In that case, set all the components to
;   have layerno = 2.
;
; 10. scale
;   Format: scale = xscale, yscale
;   Scales the display element by a horizontal scale
;   factor of xscale, and vertically by a factor of
;   yscale. Defaults to 1,1 if omitted.
;   Currently does not affect "font" elements.
;
; Some components have additional elements specific
; to themselves.
